\alias{autoplot.autodiffr_fit}
\title{Autoplot method for autodiffr_fit objects}
\usage{
autoplot.autodiffr_fit(object, type = c("summary"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{autodiffr_fit}}

\item{type}{Character string specifying the type of plot. Currently only
\code{"summary"} is supported, which shows a summary of the fit.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to plotting functions}
}
\value{
A ggplot object (if ggplot2 is available) or NULL
}
\description{
Creates diagnostic plots for autodiffr_fit objects. Currently provides
a placeholder implementation, as optimization traces are not yet stored
in fit objects.
}
\details{
This function requires the \code{ggplot2} package, which is in Suggests.
Future versions may include plots of:
\itemize{
\item Objective function value vs iteration
\item Gradient norm vs iteration
\item Parameter trace plots
}

To enable these plots, optimization traces would need to be stored during
the optimization process.

\examples{
\dontrun{
library(ggplot2)

fit <- optim_mle(loglik, start, data)
autoplot(fit)
}
}
