\title{Augment method for autodiffr_fit objects}
\usage{
\method{augment}{autodiffr_fit}(x, data = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{autodiffr_fit}}

\item{data}{The original data (optional)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently ignored)}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns:
\item{.fitted}{Fitted values (currently NA)}
\item{.resid}{Residuals (currently NA)}
}
\description{
Returns a tibble with the original data augmented with fitted values and
residuals. This is a minimal implementation that returns NA for fitted values
and residuals, as these require model-specific knowledge.
}
\details{
This is pretty minimal right now. To do it properly, we'd need model-specific
methods that know how to compute fitted values and residuals, which depends
on what kind of model you're fitting.

\examples{
\dontrun{
library(broom)

fit <- optim_mle(loglik, start, data)
augment(fit, data = original_data)
}
