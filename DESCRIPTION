Description: Provides automatic differentiation capabilities for R, enabling 
    efficient computation of gradients, Jacobians, and higher-order derivatives 
    of mathematical functions. The package implements forward and reverse mode 
    automatic differentiation algorithms to compute exact derivatives without 
    numerical approximation, making it useful for optimization, machine learning, 
    and scientific computing applications where gradient information is required.
